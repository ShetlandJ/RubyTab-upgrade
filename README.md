# RubyTab Chrome Extension - learn Ruby accidentally!

RubyTab was a self-started project that was designed to serve two purposes: 
1. For me to learn how to program Chrome extensions
2. To help me learn Ruby, as it was the introductory language at CodeClan, the Digital Skills Academy that I studied under from September 2017 to January 2018.

The chrome extension replaces your normally blank new tab on Chrome to display a short tip about Ruby syntax. It was adopted by a few of my classmates, but was never entirely designed for wider circulation. That said, it is on the Chrome Extension Store:
